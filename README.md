# NRE-Q Project

The mainly purpose of starting this project is to build simple & readable deep learning neural relation extraction tutorials for beginners who want to study natural language processing. 

This project is organized clearly.

-   Models are stored in ./models folder. You can still find descriptions of models in ./models folder.

-    Dataset contains all various common RE dataset.
    -   E.g. `dataset/sem-task8` is one of  RE dataset, and all original dataset files are contained in `dataset/sem-task8` folder directly.  In `dataset/sem-task8` you can still finds `dataset/sem-task8/train`, `dataset/sem-task8/test` , they are generated by `dataset/semProcessor.py` to build the SEMData, a subclass of torch.utils.data.Dataset, which used to build dataLoader.
-   Checkpoints : used to record your best model parameters, which is now a empty folder.
-   source : store all images used in README.md
-   semeval : contains evaluate func which is provide by official dataset owner, details are showed in `semeval/README.md`.
-   config.py : to test all provide model in this project, all you need is to change this file. contains which model you want to train & all parameters you can tunes.
-   main.py : contains iterations on train & test dataset, and generate result.txt into `semeval` dataset.
